I would like to build an "immunation validator" service that runs an API to validate immunization records. The 
validation requirements should be configurable. Because each state has different requirements, the service should 
be able to encode those requirements as configuration so that they can be updated as needed. Further, the 
requirements vary by age of the patient, usually corresponding to the year of school the patient is entering.

The service should be able to take a single patient's immunization record and validate it against a specified
state's requirements for a given age. It should also be able to take a collection of patient records and validate
them all at once against the same requirements. Each patient record will be based on the FHIR standard, but will 
contain only the information necessary to validate the patient's immunization record, plus an identifier for the
patient.

The service should have two response modes. The first mode should respond with a JSON object that contains the 
patient's identifier and a boolean value indicating whether the patient's immunization record is valid. The second
mode should respond with a JSON object that contains the patient's identifier, the "valid" boolean from the first mode, 
and, if applicable, a list of requirements that are not met. In the case of multiple patients, the mode is specified 
for the whole batch of patients. The response JSON should also be based on the FHIR standard.

Significantly, the service should not require any authentication or authorization to use, nor should it require any
personally identifiable information to be submitted. Logging should only show timestamps, requests source, a partially
masked patient identifier, response modes, and any error messages, to ensure patient privacy is protected.

The service should be built using Java Spring Boot. The code should be well-documented and follow best practices for
Java development. I would like to be able to run the service in a container.
