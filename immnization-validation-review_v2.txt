## Summary

Fixes critical bug where date-based conditions in alternate requirements were not being evaluated, allowing invalid immunization records to pass validation.

## Problem

The original code (line 137) explicitly stated it wasn't validating date conditions:
> "Note: We don't validate the condition here (e.g., '4th dose on or after 4th birthday') as that would require date parsing and age calculation. This is a simplified check."

**Impact:** Patients with incorrect dose timing were incorrectly approved for school enrollment, violating CDC immunization schedules.

## Solution

1. Created `DateConditionEvaluator` component (+120 lines)
   - Parses condition strings using regex
   - Calculates birthday milestones
   - Compares dose dates against requirements

2. Updated `ValidationService` (+48, -30 lines)
   - Integrated date condition evaluation
   - Fixed medical exemption handling
   - Improved error handling

3. Added comprehensive tests (+450 lines)
   - 12 tests covering all scenarios
   - 100% pass rate
   - Edge case coverage

## Testing
```bash
$ mvn test
[INFO] Tests run: 12, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS ✅
```

## Breaking Changes

None. Fully backward compatible.

## Before/After

**Before:**
- 4th dose before 4th birthday → ❌ VALID (wrong)
- Medical exemption, no doses → ❌ INVALID (wrong)

**After:**
- 4th dose before 4th birthday → ✅ INVALID (correct)
- Medical exemption, no doses → ✅ VALID (correct)
